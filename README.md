create a webapp where i can upload files and i can create custom urls like "whatever-the-app-domain-is.com/private-page"



the private-page is the page and for every unique string there can be a page and whoever goes to the page they can access the files on that page and even upload files on that page.



we can also make the pages private or public and for private pages there will be a password needed. you can use any service for backened and file storage.Â
